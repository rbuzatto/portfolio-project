            <p className="about__text">Hi there, my name is Rafael Buzatto de Campos. Once a Civil Engineer, other time a poker player, but now I&apos;m a fullstack developer! In frontend I have a background built up on React and Angular while at the backend in NodeJS. </p>
            <p className="about__text">I started my journey studying Civil Engineer at Unicamp. Shortly after my graduation I started a new career as successfull professional poker player, where I&apos;ve spent over 10 years in a highly competitive arena playing against some of the toughest players in the world.</p>

Started with Java, then moved to Javascript where I learned these exciting tools, React and Angular. I also enjoy working with backend, being able to do authentications and fancy stuff.</p>
